Hi There, 

I am a student from Hack React and through the partnership program I found this opportunity. Here is my code.

Sorry I saw this opportuniy just a day before and did not had a chance to do all the code clean up and add comments.

Thanks a lot for the opportunity and hopefully hear great news from you!
